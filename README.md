# Case Study: Yacht and Boat Sales Website Analysis

## Introduction
The primary objective of this data analysis project was to gain insights into the performance and trends of a Yacht and Boat sales website. Specifically, the project's aim was to analyze data related to boat prices, manufacturer trends, visitor locations, view counts, boat types, boat conditions, dimensions, build years, and materials used. This project was completed in partial fulfillment of the Google Data Analysis Professional Certificate. 

### Objectives
The client represents a yacht and boat sales website. They have tasked me with analyzing their data to achieve the following objectives:

* Understand customer preferences and behavior on their website.
* Identify key factors influencing boat and yacht sales.
* Provide insights and recommendations to optimize the website's user experience and sales strategies.

### Limitations
* **Data Availability:** The analysis relied on the availability and quality of data from the website's database. Incomplete or inaccurate data impacted the analysis.
* **External Factors:** The analysis did not account for external factors such as economic conditions, industry regulations, or global events that could influence boat sales.
* **Data Privacy:** Care was taken to ensure user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations when handling user demographic data.

### Deliverables
The project would result in a comprehensive data analysis report that includes findings, insights, visualizations, and recommendations. Supplementary materials such as charts, graphs, and tables are provided to support the analysis. Any code and scripts used for data analysis were documented and made available.
